Species assessed: 142.577 / 160.000                       Buttons/bold

To date, more than 142,500 animals have been assessed for the <strong>Red List</strong>. This is an incredible achievement. However, our work is nowhere near complete. We need to more than double the number of wild species assessed.

Meeting the goal of assessing 160.000 species will provide the most up-to-date indication of the health of the world’s biodiversity to guide critical conservation action. This is only achievable with your support.
